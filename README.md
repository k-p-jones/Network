Network
=======



Rails social media project
--------------------------



Network is a bare-bones clone of facebook, made with the intention of testing and demonstrating prior rails knowledge and picking up some new skills on the way. 

It is built in rails 4 and tested with minitest and capybara.

### Minimum Viable Product

I set my self the task of constructing a web app that had the following functionality:

* Users can have an account
* Users can upload an avatar picture
* Users have a profile page that lists some of their details and their 'thoughts'
* Users can establish friendships with other users
* Users can publish their 'thoughts'
* users can edit their thoughts
* Users can comment on their own and other users thoughts
* Users can remove their own comments and remove the comments of others from 'thoughts' they published
* Users can 'like' their own and other users 'thoughts'
